"""Count reachable ReducedGameState positions (the SECOND-reduction format).

This is the "second reduction": a position is identified by
(filled_mask, upper_total capped at 63, yahtzee_eligible bit) -- top score only
matters below 63, the bottom-section total is dropped, and the Yahtzee count
collapses to a single eligibility bit. That is `ReducedGameState`
(math/reduced_game_state.py), the solver's actual state space.

It COUNTS what's already on disk -- one row per ReducedGameState in the
`data/state_properties/level_NN/<mask>.npz` shards (each shard's `upper_total`
array has one entry per state). No unpickling, no game math recomputed.

Reports (minus terminal, x756):
  * states per level (0..13)
  * non-terminal total (levels 0..12)
  * non-terminal total x 756                   <- in-turn "positions"

Run from the math/ project dir with its venv:
    cd math
