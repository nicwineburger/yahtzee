"""Count reachable GameState positions (the FIRST-reduction format) per level.

This is the "first reduction": a position is identified by
(filled_mask, upper_total, lower_total, num_yahtzees) -- i.e. which boxes are
filled, the top-section score, the bottom-section score, and the number of
Yahtzees. That is exactly `GameState` (math/game_state.py), enumerated by
`state_computations.py` into `data/state_levels/`.

It just COUNTS what `state_computations.py` already wrote -- it does not
recompute any game math. It handles either on-disk layout:
  * sharded per-mask:  data/state_levels/level_NN/<13-bit-mask>.pkl
  * one-file-per-level: data/state_levels/level_N.pkl

Reports (385,647,100,272 board positions -> minus terminal -> x756):
  * states per level (0..13)
  * non-terminal total (levels 0..12)         <- game not yet over
  * non-terminal total x 756                   <- in-turn "positions"

Run from the math/ project dir with its venv, e.g.:
    cd math
    .venv/bin/python count_game_states.py

If it reports MISSING levels, the enumeration isn't fully on disk here; rebuild
it first with `.venv/bin/python state_computations.py` (heavy -- multiprocessing
BFS, many GB of pickles), then re-run this counter.
